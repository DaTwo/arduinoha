First off all.. You'll have to get a hold of a Arduino itself. I've ordered my Arduino Diecemila through a dutch webshop called "http://www.eztronics.nl/".

Next thing is to order the components to build a RF shield. I've bought prototyping shields and components from different suppliers. The prototyping shield will stack on top of the Arduino and connect the various components to the Arduino input/output-pins.
This type of shields van be used: "http://www.eztronics.nl/webshop/catalog/product_info.php/products_id/181".

The other components i've used to build the RF shield are:
* RX433 (http://www.okaphone.com/artikel.asp?id=137001)
* TX433 (http://www.okaphone.com/artikel.asp?id=129469)
* resistors
* led
* pot-meter
* wire

By using solder and a solderingiron you can build the shield yourself.

I've also bought myself super-het versions of the receiver. Hopefully using this receiver, i'll boost the receiving-range.
